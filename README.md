# React Native Asynchronous State Update Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications related to asynchronous operations and state updates within the `useEffect` hook. The bug arises from attempting to update component state with data fetched from an API before the asynchronous operation completes.

## Bug Description
The primary issue lies in how the `setData` state update function interacts with the asynchronous `fetch` call. Because `fetch` is asynchronous, the component might attempt to render before the API response is processed, resulting in a temporary `null` state.

## Solution
The solution involves using the `setData` function correctly in an asynchronous function, ensuring the state updates with valid data once the API call is complete. Additional loading and error handling mechanisms can further improve the user experience.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the application using a React Native development environment.
4. Observe the initial `null` state before the data is loaded.
